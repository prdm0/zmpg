Description: This library provides useful functions for survival analysis, in particular, it implements the Zero-Modified Generalized Poisson - ZMPG survival model. ZMPG is a distribution function of a discrete random variable that, through it, the ZMPG model is constructed. This discrete random variable is what is called frailty and gives rise to the ZMPG frailty model which is continuous in time. Functions are provided for the numerical calculation of cumulative distribution functions, survival functions, and hazard functions based on a base probability density function - PDF base. The probability generating functions of the Geometric Poisson distribution and ZPMG are also available. In addition, the package also provides functions to work with the inference of the ZMPG frailty model and for plotting the improper density function of the ZMPG frailty model, the cumulative distribution function, survival function, and hazard function.
